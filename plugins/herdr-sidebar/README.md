# herdr-sidebar

**The sidebar your terminal was missing** — a VS Code-inspired file explorer + source
control panel in one dockable herdr pane.

**The full tour lives in the [repo README](../../README.md)** — features, screenshots,
keys, and settings.

Quick Open is `Ctrl+P`; project text search has its own activity view and opens with `Ctrl+F`
or `Ctrl+Shift+F`. It searches live with match-case, whole-word, regex, and include/exclude filters.
Herdr keybindings can invoke `show-explorer`, `show-search`, `show-git`, or `quick-open`
directly (`-windows` suffix on Windows), so chords such as `Cmd+P` are remappable by the host.
The Git footer keeps branch switching and sync one click away in every view and can be hidden
from Settings.
Common image formats render directly in the preview pane; videos show a poster frame when
`ffmpeg` is available on `PATH`.
To open clicked files in a terminal editor, configure "Custom editor…" in sidebar Settings, then
enable "Use editor on click". Clicking an already-open file focuses its existing editor tab;
keyboard Enter continues to use the built-in preview.

## Install

Requires herdr 0.8 or newer. Source builds require Rust 1.89 or newer.

```
herdr plugin install duopss/herdr-sidebar/plugins/herdr-sidebar --ref v0.14.1
```

or from a local checkout:

```
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link .
```

Open it (or just focus a tab — the hook docks it):

```
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-sidebar.open-sidebar-windows   # windows
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-sidebar.open-sidebar           # linux / macos
```
